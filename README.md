# Angular1-echonest

This is a rewrite of my Angular 2 app in Angular 1. It is intended to be a starting point to explore the different migration paths from Ng1 to Ng2.

Please consider those two articles for complete details.

## So far

- Everything works like the Ng2 version.
- John Papa's structure
- Highly mutable data, to reflect a typical Angular app structure

## To do
- Add more tests
- Convert everything to directives
- Use the component syntax
- Add Ng2 features progressively (Router, etc.)
